## Born in 1996. Raised in a not so small town (aka New Delhi) in India. Working hard since 2013.

### What I am doing currently
Hi, my name is Aayush Malik. Currently I am working as a Data Science Associate with the International Initiative for Impact Evaluation, an organization that promotes evidence-based policy decisions in LMICs. Some of the projects I work on here include using Natural Language Processing for Evidence Synthesis, using Computer Vision, Deep Learning and Satellite Imagery to quantify key indicators for measuring the outcomes led by development interventions, and performing additional tasks such as data cleaning and web scraping for a diverse set of projects at this organization.

### What have I done previously
Previously I have worked with Harvard School of Public Health, Tata Centre for Development at UChicago, and American India Foundation. I am interested in the applications of Geospatial Analytics, Natural Language Processing, and Causal Inference for the wider benefit of international development community that is exploring novel ways of using data for social good.

### This is how I am
I call myself a highly motivated self-starter because I have been able to learn many of the things I use at my work on my own. This includes learning Python, German, and Geospatial Analytics. Lately, I have been exploring the space of MLOps for deployment of Machine Learning models that can be accessed by API calls.

My hobbies include learning languages, taking adventure trips, and exploring the culture of old cities across the world. I am a firm believer of functional minimalism and functional design.

## Born in 1996. Raised in a not so small town (aka New Delhi) in India. Working hard since 2013.

### What I am doing currently
Hi, my name is Aayush Malik. Currently I am working as a **Python Solutions Architect** at Planet Labs, the world's largest satellite imaging company that images earth daily to help save life on Earth. Some of the projects I work on here include developing custom Python solutions using Planet's API to integrate satellite imagery and analysis into customer's own systems, enabling and training people on Geospatial Data, Geospatial Analytics, and Cartography, and occasionally, travelling across the world to meet people, and solve problems for them using Python and data.

### What have I done previously
Previously I have worked with **International Initiative for Impact Evaluation, Harvard School of Public Health, Tata Centre for Development at UChicago, and American India Foundation**. I am interested in the applications of **Evidence-based Decision Making**, **Geospatial Analytics**, **Natural Language Processing**, and Causal Inference for the wider benefit of business community that want to work using more data, and less gut enzymes.

### Know more about me
I call myself a **highly motivated self-starter** because I have been able to learn many of the things I use at my work on my own. This includes learning Python, German, and Geospatial Analytics. Lately, I have been exploring the space of MLOps for deployment of Machine Learning models that can be accessed by API calls.

My hobbies include learning languages, taking adventure trips, and exploring the culture of old cities across the world. I am a firm believer of functional minimalism and functional design.
